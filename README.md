## :memo: Planning & Problem Solving

- I started planning with working on game logic.
Creating the wireframe for the page.

Finding and adjusting images.
The Audio Library I hoped to use was depreciated and I found Howler JS Audio Library and use it instead.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Programming languages:
  React
  React Hooks: useState and useEffect
  CSS
  Howler JavaScript Audio Library
  
## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Music toggle is fully functioning but when music downloaded it does not stop immidiately.

## :sob: Lessons learnt:
- Read documentation to the library use first!

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- I plan to let user chooses bettwen two different themes of the game.
