‚ÑπÔ∏è About
It's a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) app. This is a group project by Zena, George and Asela.

We used the Scavenger Hunt app as a guide when writing it. It was written in a step by step process. We collaborated via GitHub.

This app uses the Model View Controller framework. The user has the ability to add, edit and delete recipes.

üìù Planning & Problem Solving -
We began our planning on a Trello board. In the user stories, we listed functions to create for that user story with brief information.

When we had problems, we spent time together working on fixing it. Screen sharing on Zoom was used allowing all team members to see the problem.

üöÄ Cool Tech
This is an Express app developed in the Node.js platform. There is JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL databases. The database uses PSQL. Three CSS files are used. Bcrypt was used to hash passwords for security purposes.

üòß Bugs to Fix
We didn't use branches at the beginning which resulted in problems. We then realised the importance of using branches and listed the method of doing it based on the instructions and the IAs assistance. After using branches, there were some errors and incidents of merge conflicts. We worked together to fix them.

Creating the edit function took a lot of time to do with a major error ocurring.

The logout function kept having problems. We were able to get it mostly functioning properly in our local versions.

üò£ Lessons Learnt
It took time to get used to how branches work and the correct way to use them. We encountered problems with collaborating via GitHub as some mistakes were made in the process of collaboration. These mistakes were fixed. We should have used branches and developed the steps on how to collaborate from the very beginning of the project.

The Audio Library I hoped to use was depreciated and I found Howler JS Audio Library and use it instead.
